The ND(Multi-Dimentional Array) contains the array ponits to another arrays(depending on the size):
(Assume that index starts with 1 not zero)
for example we have an array A:
    |1| -> | 55 | 88 | 44 |
    001     001  004  008
A:  |2| -> | 22 | 56 | 33 |
    004     012  016  020
    |3| -> | 33 | 29 | 44 |
    008     024  028  032

each index of the array A points to another array and thus simulating the 
multi-dimentional space.

now if we want to access the element at the index (3, 3)
first you have to skip other elements and need to get the starting point of the row 3
you can do it using ( 3 - 1 ) X 3 which will skip the 6 elements in our given array.
now you have to add the index of the column - 1 to the result of the former expression
which is (3 - 1 ) x 3 + ( 3 - 1 )
now multiply it with the address of the array( assume that it's start with 000 ) + size of the
element( here 4 byte - integer )
which is: array_addr +  element_size x ( 3 - 1 ) x 3 + ( 3 - 1 ) = 000 + 4 x ( 3 - 1 ) x 3 + ( 3 - 1 ) = 032
which is exact address required element (3, 3)
