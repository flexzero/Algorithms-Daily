The time it takes to add the element to the array at beginning is: O(n)
because, take example of the following array:
|12|15|18|| |
if you have to add the element to the index 1( or 0 of course )
you have to move each element in the array to current_index + 1 location
and there is no other way to achive it using loops or iteration, ( for now may be in far future AI or Quntum can solve it )
so it takes O(n) to achieve that
same for the removing the element at the beginning

if you want to add or remove the element at the end 
it will take only constant time O(n) because for that case you don't need to
move elements,

and for adding or removing the elements at the end of the array it will take again
in worst case O(n) complexity because in worst case you have to move all the elements
in the array.
